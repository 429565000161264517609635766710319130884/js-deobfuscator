# JS Desobuscation
JS Desobfuscation is a Python script that desobfuscate JS code and it's time saver for you. Although it may not work with high degrees of obfuscation, it's a pretty nice tool to help you even if it's just a bit. You can see some example in the ``examples/`` folder. This idea came to me when I saw an obfuscated script on GitHub. I reversed it for sure lmao. All these examples are extracted from GitHub. There are some references in the script's header.

# Usage
```bash
~$ python3 main.py <source.js>
```
